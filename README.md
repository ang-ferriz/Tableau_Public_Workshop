# <p align="center"> 📈 Using Tableau Public to Visualize Climate Data 📈 | 📍 Thursday 4 of November at 18:00h CET

Analyzing data is crucial for society to best come up with solutions to the various environmental and societal challenges we face 🎯. Without it, the latest IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report, for example, wouldn’t be possible.

We’ll use Tableau Public to explore what effect the COVID-19 global lockdown had on air pollutant levels during the first quarter of 2020.

📌 The workshop is beginner-friendly! All you need is a computer, a good internet connection and to set up a Tableau Public profile to host your work and be able to use the tool (it’s simple to do and you can download the desktop version [here](https://public.tableau.com/s/)).

This folder contains the materials for the analysis:

1) At the beginning of the workshop you can find the 
[datasets](https://github.com/ang-ferriz/Tableau_Public_Workshop/tree/main/Tableau_Public_Workshop/Datasets) we are working with:
- :globe_with_meridians: Dataset 1 | `dataset1_global_no2.xlsx` (Excel file): global changes of NO2 levels. Edited data to leave only the columns we are interested in for this case. The original dataset can be found in [_Data for: Impact of Lockdown during the COVID-19 Outbreak on Global Air Quality_](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/wwjnw24xvk/1).
- :chart_with_downwards_trend: Dataset 2 | `data2_filtered.csv` (Comma Separated Values file): some NO2, PM10, PM2,5 data for specific places. The original dataset, which was a really big file with lots of measurements, was edited to make it easier to work with. The Python Jupyter Notebook, [pre_processing_Q12020_data.ipynb](https://github.com/ang-ferriz/Tableau_Public_Workshop/blob/main/pre_processing_Q12020_data.ipynb), with the cleaning steps is available in the repo just to show how the original dataset from the [_Air Quality Open Data Platform_](https://aqicn.org/data-platform/covid19/) was filtered.
            
2) [Tableau link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/.ngela4803/viz/Workshop_Live_04Nov/COVID-19AirQualityChanges?publish=yes) for the final dashboard and the file of the Tableau workbook. You can download it and open the workspace in your local machine.

I encourage you to build the graphs for the other two pollutants (PM2,5 and PM10), add a text block to the dashboard or also try to build it for another case study to explore the data and practice with Tableau:

3) (_On Friday_) You will find here some of the insights from the data and also the most interesting questions answered during the workshop so you can revisit them easily.

Ready?! 🙌
