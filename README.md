# Tableau Public Workshop - 📍 Thursday 4 of November at 18:00h CET

Analyzing data is crucial for society to best come up with solutions to the various environmental and societal challenges we face 🎯. Without it, the latest IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report, for example, wouldn’t be possible.

We’ll use Tableau Public to explore what effect the COVID19 global lockdown had on air pollutant levels during the first quarter of 2019.

📌 The workshop is beginner-friendly! All you need is a computer, a good internet connection and to set up a Tableau Public profile to host your work and be able to use the tool (it’s simple to do and you can download the desktop version [here](https://public.tableau.com/s/)).

This folder contains the materials for the guided analysis:
- At the beggining of the workshop you can find: [Datasets](https://github.com/ang-ferriz/Tableau_Public_Workshop/tree/main/Tableau_Public_Workshop/Datasets)
- When the workshop ends you will also find the link for the dashboard and the file of the Tableau workbook

Ready?! 🙌
